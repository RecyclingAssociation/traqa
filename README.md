# Traqa

We recommend reading the documentation over at https://docs.traqa.io for the latest guidance.

Led by industry trade body The Recycling Association, Traqa is a collaborative platform to automate the transfer of information between all parties in the recycling supply chain, tracking loads for export from origin to end destination using the latest in cutting edge technology.

The Recycling Association have created some data structures to facilitate the transfer of this information and create a standardised dataset that meets the requirements of the Pickup to Port process.

There are 2 key points that data needs to be transferred to create efficiency during this process.

1. Load Plan
2. Weighbridge Data

# Load Plan 

The shipper needs to provide to the load site enough information to pre-populate their software to remove unecessary manual entry and provide an expected load plan to thier system.

It is key that the loading references are unique to the shipper, as when the container is loaded the weighing information can be matched and returned to the shipper automatically.

The load sites require:

* Shipper
* PO Number
* Description of Goods 
* Loading Reference
* Planned Loading DateTime
* Port of Loading 
* Port of Discharge
* Carrier

# Weighbridge Data 

The weighbridge software will need to capture from the loading site the following information to complete the dataset and enable the container to move efficiently through the supply chain.

* Container Number
* Seal Number
* No Bales
* Net Weight / Product Weight 
* Verified Gross Mass (VGM Weight)
* Haulier 
* Vehicle Registration
