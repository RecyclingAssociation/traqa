# Samples 

The files in this directory are indicative of the file formats that are accepted and returned by Traqa.

## API Samples

The prefered method of connectivity is to use the API, it provides more comprehensive dataset and files are validated and nothing lost in translation.

* [LoadPlan](api-loadPlan.json)
* [WeighBridge](api-sampleWeighbridge.json)
* [Completed Loads](api-completedLoad.json)

Traq have the latest API spec published on SwaggerHub: XXX

## Excel Samples

There is also a basic option to provide conenctivity using Excel, allowing all to participate in Traqa without integrating the API into their systems, useful during the testing phase, but we highly recomend using the API over this method.

* [Load Plan](excel-loadPlan.csv)
* [Completed Loads](excel-completedLoad.csv)
